# Microsoft Copilot Case Study

## Overview and Origin
Microsoft Copilot is a generative AI chatbot created by Microsoft in partnership with OpenAI. Copilot was launched in February of 2023 as Bing Chat and incorporated into the companies web browser Edge. This project is funded by Microsoft, and while the total investment is unknown it has been extensive. After entering into to a partnership in 2016, Microsoft invested $1 Billion in OpenAI in 2016 and another $2 Billion in 2021. Microsoft has also invested heavily in the form of compute power leveraging the immense scalability of Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure.  
## Business Activities
According to Microsoft the primary goal of Copilot is to *"reduce digital debt and increase productivity so people can focus on work that is uniquely human."*[1] The company aims to make Copilot an indespensible digital assistant for its vast install base of M365 users across Enterprise, SMB, and Consumer. By incorporating generative AI into Microsofts existing family of products they are able to offer users a productivity experince their competetitors can not.

Copilot leverages large language models (LLMs) developed by OpenAI and builds upon them with Microsoft's technology.  Copilot is their biggest bet since Azure, which has played a major role in the development of OpenAI's Chat GPT and Copilot. 

## Landscape
In recent years Microsoft has faced fierce competition from major player in business productivity and cloud servicess such as Google, Amazon, Meta and IBM. Copilot is their biggest bet since Azure, which has played a major role in the development of OpenAI's Chat GPT and Copilot. 

 >We’ve worked together to build multiple supercomputing systems powered by Azure, which we use to train all of our models. Azure’s unique architecture design has been crucial in delivering best-in-class performance and scale for our AI training and inference workloads. Microsoft will increase their investment in these systems to accelerate our independent research and Azure will remain the exclusive cloud provider for all OpenAI workloads across our research, API and products. - [OpenAI Blog](https://openai.com/blog/openai-and-microsoft-extend-partnership) [2].

## Results

Copilot has has a massive impact on Microsoft's business thus far, establishing them as a major player in the AI field. As for the end user, increased productivity is the aim and accoring to Microsoft "Early users of Copilot reported productivity gains and time savings consistent with the gains developers experienced using GitHub Copilot" [3] 

Copilot for Enterpirise customers was released for general availability in October 2023 and is avaialble as an add on to Microsoft 365. Sales figures have not been release as of December 2023. 

## Recommendations

I would advise Microsfot to increase the integrations with third-party services and applications such as Slack, Trello, Canva, and project managment software. These integrations would leverage API's as well as the underlining technologes of Copilot such as machine learning, large language models, and natural language processing.
